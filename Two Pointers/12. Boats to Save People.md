Explaining

```markdown
# Explaining
* The most important step is sorting the array
* we add the left number to the right number if they are equal or smaller than the limit we increment left and decrement right and add one boat, otherwise we decrement only right because the number in the right needs a complete boat but it self.
# Key Idea:
'sorting'
