    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        results = 0
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        while left < right:
            area = (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right])
            results = max(results, area)
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left+=1
            else:
                right-=1
        return results

Increment the left ptr if itâ€™s smaller than the rught ptr and vice versa
